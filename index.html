				<p class="intro">
					Hey, I'm Ayush. I'm a third year Computer Science undergraduate from IIIT-Bh. I spend most of my time hacking
					on open source projects, watching football, reading anything I find interesting on the internet and watching
					random stuff on YouTube. <br><br>

					I'm fascinated by various aspects of Computers, but I find the field of Machine learning to be really intriguing
					in particular. Do go through my GitHub profile for more projects. <br><br>

					In the past, I've been a Google Summer of Code student with The Julia Language, working on the Flux machine
					learning ecosystem. You can find more about my project <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6242927298740224/">here</a>.<br><br>

					I love deep conversations with interesting people. So, if you have any interesting ideas in mind and would love
					to share them, please don't hesitate!

						<ul>
							<li>September'19: It's official: I'll most probably be visiting the Australian National University
								for 6 months, starting Dec'19, working on a test suite for driverless car research. Exciting times
								indeed!<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>September'19: Successfully completed GSoC'19 with Mozilla. I've published a brief blog about my work on medium :
								<a href="https://medium.com/@ayush1999/gsoc19-mozilla-a185b66d9564">here</a>.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>August'19 : Back in India! Heading to my university at the moment. It was a great experience
								working in UCL. I hope to continue contributing as and when I get time.<br><br></li>
							<li>May'19: Very rarely do I have more than one good news in a single month. I guess this is one of those rare
								occasions. I got my talk selected in JuliaCon'19 in University of Maryland, Baltimore. It's great to get
								this opportunity to showcase my work to a wide audience. Hopefully my visa gets approved (which is doubtful,
								since I'll be applying from UK,which isn't my home country.). Let's see how this goes. <br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								May'19 : Some good news: I got my Google Summer of Code project selected. This time, I'll be working under the 
								Mozilla organization on the <i>bugbug</i> project. I'll be tough managing it with my project in UCL, let's 
								see how it goes! (fingers crossed!) <br><br>
							</li>
							<li>April'19 : It's official. I'll be joining University College London (UCL) department of Statistical Science
								during the summer of 2019 as a visiting researcher. Looking forward to this new adventure in life!<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>October'18 : Attending PyCon'18 India in Hyderabad. Excited to meet all awesome people!<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								August'18 : Attending JuliaCon'18 in UCL, London! This'll be the first I'll travel alone outside my country!
								It'll be exciting to meet all the cool people I've been working with over the past 3 months.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								July'18 : Got a chance to visit the Google office in Mumbai, India for an event. Had a great time meeting fellow
								GSoC students (among others) and interacting with interns and cloud engineers at Google. Special thanks to the Google team
								for organizing this.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								April'18 : Finally some good news after a series of dissappointing end semester exmas. I got selected into Google
								Summer of Code'18. I'll be working under <i>The Julia Language, NumFOCUS</i>, on <i>Model import and export for 
								Flux</i>. It's going to be a great opportunity to learn from the community.<br><br>
							</li>
							<li>
								August'16 : I'll start my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from International Institute of Information Technology,
								Bhubaneswar. This is a big step in my life, Kinda excited but anxious at the same time. Let's see what this holds for me.
							</li>
